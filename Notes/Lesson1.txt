Lesson 1

Section OpenGL
--------------

* OpenGL is API specification

* In old days there was the 'immediate mode' or 'fixed function pipeline'
It was easy to use but not flexible enough.

'Core-profile' mode is more flexible but harder to understand and use.

* Some functionallity is in extensions, we get the chance to check for the extension
availability at runtime.

* OpenGL is state machine, there are functions for changing state and functions
for using state.

* OpenGL has the concept of object which groups a part of OpenGL state.
Example is an object that stores the settings for drawing window.

Using objects is simple:
	# first we create an object
	# then we bind it
	# set options
	# and un-bind the object
	
	
Question: why is it necessary to bind/un-bind objects?
